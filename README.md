### Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 from PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app company. Then create a compelling visualization for the CEO and a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type; using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib., so in Jupiter Notebook and Matplotlib I created some charts to show the relationship between the type of city; urban, suburban and rural. Also, the relationship between the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers.

### Results

From the DataFrame image below we can see there is a relation between population and the quantity of rides. The more populated is a city lower is the average fare per ride. This makes sense because people from uban and suburban have more access to rides. However, the average fare per driver increases in the rural areas. Less drivers higher fare per drive and ride.

The urban fares were higher in February and March, but the fares dropped in April.
The suburban fares were higher in February and then dropped for March and April. However, it seems to increase for May.
The rural fares increased in late February and late March, but the fares dropped in April.
