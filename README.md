### Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 from PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app company. Then create a compelling visualization for the CEO and a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type; using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib., so in Jupiter Notebook and Matplotlib I created some charts to show the relationship between the type of city; urban, suburban and rural. Also, the relationship between the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers.
